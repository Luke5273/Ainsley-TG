- Very varied, could be really anything
	- Shed behind a general store
	- basement of a pub
	- closet in a hotel
- Mainly used as a store house or intermediary meeting location
	- Not as secure/secretive as the districts, hence is used for more explicit interactions
	- Only houses a few grunts, local security for businesses that double as guards for stored items
- All within about 4 hours of the district hideout

 - Entry
	 - Much like the district hideouts, entry is through a gate or door
	 - Password changes in similar rotation to the district hideout
		- Maybe each uses the same cycle, but with a different offset?
		- Or a specific subset
			- Could make for an interesting plot point, trying to gain access to the district hideout by stealing the lists from the less secure mini hideouts
	- Apart from that, each is unique
- Interior
	- Often just a single room
	- Not much use for more than that
- Exit
	- Same as entry
