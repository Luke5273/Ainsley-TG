- Is pretty standardised, devils and all that
- Used as the general hideout
- seen as smallest unit, mini doesnt really have any freedom while these folks do
- Normally about 30 people staying there employed full time
	- guards
		- 3x8 hour shifts
	- cleaning
		- 2xweek
	- cook/servers
	- specific to specialties

- Entry
	- entry through a fake sewer grate, normally near a business that is being offered [[protection]]
	- passcode that changes often. fortnightly rotation based on something (talk to Ainsley, maybe based on phase of moon?), uses a cypher on an object (think of rfid card with a password on top) which is waved over the grate
	- sewer tunnel, but the water is actually cycling in a moat like structure around the middle
	- secret brick  that needs to be pressed to open the hideout in the centre
- Interior 
	- Central column
		- very vertical
		- lift [Patnoster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvvbn7O1nus)
		- each floor has a door with a specific animal, denotes security level
			- same object from before is used to open 
			- if a wrong level object is used more than once, stone golem creature spawns from surrounding wall
		- The bottom is the common area, bar/mess-esque in the centre with some offices along the walls. 
			- Generally lively, places up until now have been completely barren
		- Bottom and top floors are about 4000sqft
	- Individual floors
		- The floors themselves are varied from place to place
		- Examples of low security level areas would be
			- map room
			- sleeping quarters (for grunts, higher end members tend to stay by themselves)
			- pantry
			- general armoury
			- general library
		- Examples of medium security
			- lower offices, more like cubicles
			- guest rooms
			- magic armoury
			- magic library
		- Examples of high security
			- Treasury
			- proper offices
			- lift control room
			- meeting room
			- *High security rooms can be varied, different hideouts will have [[Location hierarchy|specialties]]*
- Exit
	- The main entrance can be used as an exit
	- There is also a link to the actual sewer system, but one way
		- Constantly guarded, only lets people out
